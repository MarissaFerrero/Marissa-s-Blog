      <p>So far in assignment 1 I have finished doing a user persona and empathy map on Rory Gilmore. Rory is a high school student who is wanting tot go to an Ivy League university. I want to create a website that customers can use to easily apply. The empathy map is there to help me see what Rory is thinking, feeling, doing and saying. I have also completed a Venn diagram which helps to see what shared goal I have as a designer with users. I’m currently finishing the last quarter of the assignment which is current user flow and customer journey map. This planning/research assignment will help me with the next assignment exponentially.
