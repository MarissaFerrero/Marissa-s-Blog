      <p>This week I learnt about the different UX laws. These laws include but are not limited to Fit’s Law, Hick’s Law, Jacob’s Law, Law of Pragnanz, Miller’s Law and Parkinson’s Law. There are other UX laws but these are the main ones, they are also what I will be considering when designing my website. I’ve of most of these UX laws before but one that was new to me and I found very interesting was Law of Pragnanz. This law talks about the complexity of images and how people perceive them. I learnt that circles are easier to focus on than squares which is why most social media platforms use circles as display pictures. WE also covered colour theory and its importance in cresting a visual hierarchy with colour contrasts. This will help to ensure elements that need to stand out on my website such as buttons do and increase readability and clarity. I also learn about Contast Ratio which is a website where upload colours and check its contrast ratio.
