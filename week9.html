      <p>This week covers EditorX and its basics. This is just a quick overview of how EditorX works, how to create pages and add elements to nav, content sections and footers. I’ve never used a this software before so it was very interesting trying to familiarise myself with it and find my way around the different sections. This week I start creating my website on EditorX and using my prototype as a starting point/guide. I’m finding it difficult to navigate EditorX and create the website I had in my prototype. As I continue on developing my website I decide to scratch EditorX and use SquareSpace instead. I find it easier to navigate so I made the changes accordingly. I finished up assignment 2-1 this week which was the prototype for my website. The wireframes and prototypes done during this stage sets me up for the work I’m doing on Squarespace. It is what I base my web design off when working on Squarespace.
