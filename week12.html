      <p>Over this trimester, I am surprised by how much I have learnt. At the start of the trimester I had never coded any before, let alone a whole website blog! I am very happy with how my blog has turned out, it may not look like much but it took a lot time and work. I enjoyed the assignments for this course and the website I have developed called ‘Pathways’. It took me a while to brainstorm what type of service/ website I wanted make but it was all worth it at the end as I don’t think anyone has thought of this before (or not that I know of). Some critiques I have for myself would be time-management. Although I am happy with how all of my assignments have turned out, I will say that I could always produce better work if I would’ve planned out my schedule and time accordingly. Safe to say I really enjoyed taking this course and this trimester as a whole!
