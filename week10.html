      <p>There are a few problems I am facing during this assignment. The first being the workspace layout of Squarespace. They have a viewing space and edit space which I had to flick between quite frequently. I could only edit one page at a time and would have to save and exit editing mode in order to go into another page. This was an infuriating and time consuming process. </P>
<P>
I went on to modifying recurring elements on the website and found another problem with my pages not syncing up. I found that when i changed my footer in the homepage it would only update that footer in certain other pages but not all of them. This would mean that I had to go through and check every other page to see if the changes were made. I had to manually make the same changes to other pages that would not sync up. 
</P>

Another similar but more painstaking slow was my buttons not syncing up. There is a system within Squarespace that should sync up button changes. This worked for every page except my home page. Not only did the button on this page not sync up but when I tried to manually change the colours, it refused to change. I pondered on this issue for longer than I should have. This could have just been a bug or my computer slowly down from being on for hours but the problem went away when I took a break for a few hours. 
</P>

Since I have already done a good portion of my website on Squarespace and I’m running out of time, I can’t switch back to EditorX or any other CMS system. I have to stick it out with Squarespace and just deal with the problems as it comes. In saying this, the problems are not exponential.
