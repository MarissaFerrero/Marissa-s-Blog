      <p>This week I learnt about the different ways to link pages through images/text and how to incorporate unordered and ordered lists. Learning how to link different pages is crucial when I think about my website blog as I will have to link different blog post pages to my home page. The lists will also be useful when writing up my blog posts. We also touched upon understanding users which leads into our first project. I learnt the importance of understanding who my users are, what their goals are and what is stopping them from achieving their goals with my product. There are many different things to consider when creating a product so creating a user persona for my target audience will ensure I create the best possible product that caters to my users needs and wants with consideration to how they think and feel.  This can be applied to web design as I need to be aware of how my website will influence users and if they are able to easily use it.
