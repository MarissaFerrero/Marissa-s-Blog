      <p>This week on the coding side I learnt about divs and flexboxes. Divs are essentially empty boxes that can be edited using css its a good way of managing where elements go on a website. Divs can be used to seperate different sections for a website. This could include but is not limited to header/ nav bar, about section, footer etc. I can also adjust the height and with to be responsive to desktop and phone. There are two types of divs that can be used; ID and class. In the lecture this week we talked about user flows. Which is the path a user takes from beginning to end which in my case will be the path they take on my website. There are 3 main reasons why we create user flows. Finding optimisation point, communicate fluently on what my designs will be, and enhance user experience overall. This week we also looked at customer journey maps which is another part of assignment 1. Customer journey maps is a tool that helps us see a users typical experience in a set scenario. It helps us understand what a user is feeling and going through and we are able to understand common user pain points in their journey. From this I can personalise and adjust my experience accordingly.  </p>
