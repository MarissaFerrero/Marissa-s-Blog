      <p>An interesting thing I learnt this week was the use of live server where changes I make will automatically save and refresh on google, this saves me a lot of time and effort. I learnt how to use css to change the way elements look on a page, this includes where they’re placed, colours, borders etc. This was a good intro and starting point to css. This week we are onto the second part of the assignment which is the Venn diagram. I learnt about user goal, success boundaries and design goals. Users goals can be split into three different sections;  life goals, experience goals, and end goals. I explored reasons why users will be on my website and what do they need help with. A key point for this week is designing with a purpose. This all ties into the Venn diagram which is the overlapping shared goals between designer and user. I learnt about the importance of KPI’s this week in measuring the success of the website through set goals and traffic. </p>
