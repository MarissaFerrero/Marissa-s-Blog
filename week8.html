      <p>This week we continue learning about responsive grids that changes to accomodate a mobile, tablet and desktop view. Typefaces was discuss in this week lecture where we cover readability and making content easy to read and appealing. As a web designer I need to take into consideration typefaces, point sizes, line-spacing, and letter spacing. My main header font should match the mood of my website since it is the first thing users will see and it will also be used across over platforms when advertising. Creating visual hierarchy is crucial to good designs so I will need to make sure I have clear contrasts for my headings and enough space between elements.
