      <p>This week I learnt about css grids. This includes creating columns and rows which will help when coding my blog as I may need to have seperate columns in the nav bar, blog section and footer. It will especially help in the blog section as I would ideally have different columns and rows for each of the 12 weeks I blog. Something interesting and very helpful I learnt this week was how to differentiate nav tags in css when they all look the same. I can do this by adding a “:nth to the code line-of-type” which will figure out which nav it is depending on the order it is in. </p>
