      <p>This week was about combining all I’ve learnt in coding so far and using that to make a website, this includes html basics, CSS box model, CSS grids and other bits and pieces I’ve learnt along the way.  A new and interesting thing I’ve learn this week is how to use google fonts in my code. I can do this by searching up google fonts and copying the link to place in my exiting website code. It was a lot of information to take in but I am able to look back at the recording when coding my blog as it covers most of the elements I need. In this point and time I am racing to finish the last few elements left on my website. I am happy with the outcome of it and only wish I had more time for the things I would’ve liked to incorporate.
